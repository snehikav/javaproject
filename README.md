The web based “flight reservation system” project is an attempt to design the basic concepts of
flight reservation system. The system helps the user to find & book the flight from different cities
and sends e-mail confirmation to the customer.
The system allows the customer to search for flights that are available between the two cities,
namely the “Departure city” and “Arrival city” for a particular departure and arrival dates. The
system displays all the flight’s details such as flight no, name, price, etc.
After search the system display list of available flights for the entered details and allows customer
to choose a particular flight. Then the system asks to enter the customer details such as name,
mobile number, email id, etc.
After selecting the confirmation, the system redirects to the payment. Then the user enters the card
details and book the flight. The system updates with the new reservation in the database. The
system allows the customer to check-in for the specific flight and also mention the number of bags
carrying for this journey.
